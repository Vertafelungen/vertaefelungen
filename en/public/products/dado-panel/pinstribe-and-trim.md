This paneling combines plain boards and decorative trims – elements that are joined with tongue and groove and placed alternately. What makes it special is the range of decorative profiles available for the trim. A traditional wainscot ideal for both country houses and hotels.

Panels are made to order per linear meter. We manufacture them from solid oak or pine. On request, the panels can be delivered sanded and prepared for a coloured finish.
