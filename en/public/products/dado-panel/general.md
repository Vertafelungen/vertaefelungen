# Historical Wood Panelling – Origin, Function, and Aesthetic Role

Wood panelling has been a defining element of bourgeois interiors for centuries – serving functional, climatic, and decorative purposes.

## Historical Function

- **Thermal insulation**: warms up cold exterior walls
- **Acoustic insulation**: sound-dampening in formal rooms
- **Decoration**: a symbol of taste, status, and modernity

## Typical Construction

Especially during the Historicism period (ca. 1850–1910), a panelled wall consisted of:
- **Base section** (sometimes tiled or stone-clad)
- **Framed panels** (with mouldings, carved or plain)
- **Top rail** (often a decorative ledge or part of the window structure)

## Use in Old Apartments

- From ~1850: in parlours, dining rooms, studies
- From ~1900: prefabricated panelling also in hallways and bedrooms
- Especially common in:
  - Viennese tenement buildings
  - Berlin Mietskasernen
  - Upper-storey apartments in Hamburg

## Style Variants

- Neo-Renaissance: blocky, cassette-like designs
- Art Nouveau: floral, curved transitions
- Gründerzeit: strong mouldings, often combined with stucco ceilings

## Relevance for Restoration

- Respect original materials (wood type, construction, surface)
- Consider room height and window proportions
- Maintain or recreate historical paint layers in reversible form if possible
