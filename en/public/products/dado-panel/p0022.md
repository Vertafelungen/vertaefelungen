  Town Hall LÃ¼beck - The centre of the Hanseatic League. This is where from the 14th to the 18th century the Hansa Days took place, where co-operation was regulated. The city council still debates current issues here today. LÃ¼beck is a very proud city, which is clearly demonstrated by its buildings. Inside and out. The entire length of the corridor on the upper hall way and in the âLong Houseâ is stuffed with a coffered panelling. All rails and frames are made of oak, but the cassettes are of pine. This panelling was probably created during the renovation of 1893.
