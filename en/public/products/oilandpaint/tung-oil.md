# Tung Oil – Chinese Wood Oil with High Water Resistance

Tung oil (also: China wood oil) is a traditional drying oil extracted from the seeds of the tung tree. Used for centuries in East Asia, it is a high-performance alternative to linseed oil.

## Origin and Extraction

- Origin: China, Vietnam, Taiwan
- Extracted from the seeds of *Aleurites fordii* (tung tree)
- Especially rich in alpha-eleostearic acid

## Drying and Protective Properties

- Polymerizes faster than linseed oil
- Forms a harder, more water-resistant surface
- Cures by oxidation without added solvents

## Advantages

- **More water-repellent than linseed oil**
- Faster drying (12–24 hours)
- Smooth, satin finish without additives
- Deep penetration with strong curing

## Disadvantages

- More expensive than linseed oil
- Less reversible in restoration contexts
- May lead to uneven sheen if improperly applied

## Use in Panelling

Tung oil is particularly useful for:
- **humid areas (e.g., stairwells, vestibules)**
- **areas with frequent wear (e.g., baseboards)**
