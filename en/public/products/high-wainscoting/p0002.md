  The tower hall of the Michel has high oak panelling dating from the reconstruction period of 1906-1912. The vertical panelling runs around the entire room and creates a clear, unobtrusive structure. The panelling consists of a clear base and head section with a 2-row, vertical coffered paneling that can be easily adapted to individual room dimensions. We manufacture the panelling true to the original in oak and also in pine. On request.
