# Lübeck – Schiffergesellschaft (P0014)

Founded in 1401, Lübeck’s Schiffergesellschaft (Seafarers’ Guild) was established to provide food and housing for widows and orphans of sailors lost at sea. Its interior is richly adorned with ship models and curiosities brought back by Lübeck sea captains over centuries. In 1868, the guild decided to convert the main hall into a restaurant – still in operation today.

**Form, proportions, and structure** of the wall panelling in the Gildesaal are typical of Lübeck’s regional style. The layout with two vertical panels above a carved or pictorial field can also be seen in local churches – but the guild’s version is particularly whimsical.

Custom-made to order – production time approx. **6 weeks**, plus shipping.
