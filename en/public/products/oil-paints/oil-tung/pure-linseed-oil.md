## Description
Refined linseed oil with low acidity, free from suspended solids and mucilage, without added driers. Ideal for first priming of raw wood with high penetration depth.

## Application
1. Apply to wood several times over two days until saturated.  

2. After 1–2 days, wipe off excess oil with a clean cloth.  

3. Observe drying time and reapply if needed.

## Technical Notes
- Dries by oxidative polymerisation, water-repellent and breathable.  

- Strong initial odor that dissipates after a few weeks.  

- Safety note: oily cloths may self-ignite – dispose of responsibly.
