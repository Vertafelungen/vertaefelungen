# Linseed Oil – Properties and Use in Wood Finishing

Linseed oil is one of the oldest natural wood protection agents. Extracted from flax seeds, it penetrates deeply, forms little surface film, and provides long-lasting protection indoors.

## Origin and Composition

- Extracted by pressing the seeds of the flax plant (*Linum usitatissimum*)
- Main components: triglycerides with a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids
- Cures by oxidation (not evaporation)

## Application in Wall Panelling

Linseed oil is particularly well suited for historical wall panelling because it:
- penetrates deeply into the wood,
- enhances the natural sheen,
- creates breathable surfaces.

It is ideal for:
- **untreated softwoods**
- **stained woods (e.g., potassium permanganate)**
- **refining surfaces after reconstruction or installation**

## Application Tips

- Apply thinly and remove excess after 30 minutes
- Multiple coats possible with intermediate drying
- Drying time: 1–3 days per coat, depending on temperature and air circulation

## Advantages

- Fully biodegradable
- Reversible (ideal for restorations)
- No film formation – no peeling

## Disadvantages

- Long drying time
- Less resistant to liquids than oil-resin mixtures
