## Description
Tung oil – also known as Chinese wood oil – is a plant-based oil that penetrates deep into the wood, cures by oxidation, and forms a tough, water-resistant yet breathable finish. It’s ideal for wood subject to heavy use, both indoors and outdoors.

- Pure, cold-pressed, solvent-free  

- Cures fully over several days  

- Food-safe once fully cured (as per supplier)

## Application
1. Apply thinly with brush or cloth to absorbent, untreated wood  

2. Remove excess oil within 30 minutes  

3. Apply 2–4 coats depending on wood absorption  

4. Allow to cure thoroughly – not suitable for standing water

## Technical Notes
- Cures through oxidation, not evaporation  

- No surface film – no flaking or peeling  

- Suitable for cutting boards, toys, outdoor decks  

- Dispose of oily cloths responsibly (risk of self-ignition)
