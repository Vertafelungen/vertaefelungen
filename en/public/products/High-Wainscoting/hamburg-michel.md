# Hamburg – Michel (P0002)

The tower hall of the Michel has high oak panelling dating from the reconstruction period of 1906–1912. The vertical coffered design runs around the entire room and creates a clear, unobtrusive structure.

The panelling consists of a clearly defined base and head section with a **2-row, vertical coffered layout**, which can be easily adapted to individual room dimensions.

We manufacture the paneling true to the historical original — in **oak** or optionally in **pine**.
