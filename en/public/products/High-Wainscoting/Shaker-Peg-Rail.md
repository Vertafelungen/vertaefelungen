# Tall Shaker-Style Panel with Peg Rail (P0017)

This paneling is not only a visual highlight – it’s also extremely functional. The peg rail is made exactly as seen in the Shaker Museum Enfield, USA. Based on original designs, it allows items like pots, scissors, chairs, or coats to be hung directly on the wall – tidy, practical, and beautiful.

**Form, proportions, and construction** follow historical references. Made from solid pine or oak. Optionally pre-treated for painting.

Custom-made to order – production time approx. **6 weeks**, plus shipping.
