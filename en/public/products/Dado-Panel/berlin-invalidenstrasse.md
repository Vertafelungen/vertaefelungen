# Berlin – Invalidenstraße (P0018)

Around 130 years ago, this location was home to Bäckerei Balzer. The walls were lined with summery floral tiles and finely profiled woodwork – and surely, the bread rolls smelled twice as good!

Today, it’s a burger place – the atmosphere is, well, less charming. Hopefully, the next tenant will appreciate the historic beauty of this space.

**The combination of wood panelling and ceramic tiles** is still common in restaurants and grocery shops. Tiles add a decorative layer and help visually divide large surfaces into structured sections.

The tiles in this example are supplied by the **GOLEM Manufaktur**.

Made to order – production time approx. **6 weeks**, plus shipping.
