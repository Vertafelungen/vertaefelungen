# Product FAQ: Panelling P0003 (Green Dining Room – Morris Room, Victoria & Albert Museum London)
## 1. What is special about panelling P0003?
This panelling is an authentic reproduction of the wood-panelled wall design from the “Green Dining Room” (now Morris Room) at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. It combines art-historically significant design, meticulous craftsmanship and exceptional colour. The original was created in 1867/68 to designs by William Morris and Philip Webb.

## 2. Who designed the original and how did the commission come about?
The design was created by William Morris and his firm (Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.), working with architect Philip Webb and artist Edward Burne-Jones. The project was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole, then director of the South Kensington Museum. The aim was to create a prestigious dining room as part of the world’s first museum restaurant.
