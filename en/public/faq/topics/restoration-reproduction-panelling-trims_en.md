# FAQ: Restoration & Reproduction of Historic Panelling and Wood Trims

## 1. What does restoration and reproduction mean for historic panelling and trims?

Restoration means the careful repair, preservation and completion of original elements while respecting the historic fabric. Reproduction refers to the faithful manufacture of new parts based on historic models to replace missing or destroyed features.

---

## 2. What is the typical restoration process?

- **Survey:** Careful documentation of measurements, profiles, wood species and damage (photos, drawings, templates)
- **Material analysis:** Selection of suitable woods to match the original
- **Repair and completion:** Filling losses, producing new parts, profile-accurate fitting
- **Surface treatment:** Cleaning, removal of old coatings, re-oiling, waxing or lacquering as appropriate
- **Prevention:** Protect against moisture, pests, misuse

## 3. What are common challenges in reproduction?

- Sourcing matching wood species (e.g. slow-grown pine, oak)
- Accurate reproduction of historic profiles and joints
- Coordination with conservation authorities and documentation requirements
- Adapting to irregularities and settlement in old buildings
- Traditional craft: use of historic tools and techniques

---

## 4. What should be considered when fitting reproductions?

- Reversible fixing and minimally invasive installation
- Precise fitting without stressing original fabric
- Marking or documenting any new elements

---

## 5. Which materials and finishes are preferred?

- Solid wood of the same type and quality as the original
- Traditional finishes: oils, waxes, shellac, sometimes stains or linseed oil paint
- Avoid modern synthetic varnishes or unsuitable coatings

---

## 6. How is authenticity of reproduction ensured?

- Accurate transfer of measurements and profiles, full documentation and material evidence
- Coordination with conservation officers and, if relevant, architects
- Each new part should be individually labelled (inventory, numbering)
