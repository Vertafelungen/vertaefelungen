# FAQ: Linseed Oil as a Wood Preservative in Heritage Work
## 1. What is linseed oil and what is it used for?
Linseed oil is a natural oil obtained by cold or hot pressing flax seeds (Linum usitatissimum). It has been used for centuries to impregnate and finish wood, and also as a binder in paints, varnishes and putties. Especially in heritage conservation, linseed oil is valued for its excellent wood protection, breathability and natural composition.

## 2. What is the difference between raw linseed oil and linseed oil varnish?
**Raw linseed oil:**

- Pure, unboiled and chemically untreated linseed oil.

- Dries slowly in air (often several days), penetrates deep into the wood and allows for a long open time.

- Used for traditional impregnation, restoration and exterior wood protection.

**Linseed oil varnish:**

- Produced by boiling linseed oil (often with driers/siccatives added).

- Dries significantly faster than raw oil (often within a day), forms a slightly glossy and firmer surface.

- Mainly used for coatings, primers and in combination with pigments, as it cures more quickly.

## 3. What does linseed oil smell like?
Fresh, cold-pressed linseed oil has a mild, nutty, slightly “green” scent, often perceived as pleasant.  
Linseed oil varnish or oil that is oxidising as it dries may have a more pronounced, slightly “warm”, hay- or straw-like smell, depending on the product and processing.  
Note: If applied too thickly or in poor ventilation, the odour can become intense and last for days or weeks until the oil is fully cured. Old or improperly stored linseed oil products may smell rancid.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of linseed oil as a wood preservative?
**Advantages:**

- Natural origin, no solvents, highly breathable

- Penetrates deep and protects from within

- Promotes natural ageing and patina

- Sustainable, environmentally friendly, easy to restore

- Easy to refresh (can be renewed without sanding)

**Disadvantages:**

- Long drying times, especially for raw linseed oil

- Odour development during drying

- Non-film-forming, so only limited protection against standing water

- Requires ongoing cleaning and care

## 5. What standards and guidelines apply in heritage conservation?
- **WTA leaflets** (e.g. WTA 2-10-12/D)

- **DIN 68800** (wood protection)

- Recommendations of federal heritage authorities, Fraunhofer IBP, BDA

- Many restorers and specialists follow these standards for materials and application.

## 6. How is linseed oil applied to wood?
1. Prepare the surface: clean, dry, and dust-free.

2. Apply linseed oil generously, allow to penetrate (15–60 minutes depending on absorbency).

3. Wipe off any excess oil after a maximum of 1 hour!

4. Repeat 2–3 times as needed.

5. After the final treatment, allow the wood to ventilate and dry thoroughly (1–2 days for varnish, several days for raw oil).

---

## 7. Are there safety and environmental aspects?
- Linseed oil itself is non-toxic, but oil-soaked cloths are **self-igniting**! Always allow them to dry spread out or store them in water.

- Old coatings may darken or yellow.

- For food-contact surfaces (e.g. worktops), use only pure, cold-pressed linseed oil.
