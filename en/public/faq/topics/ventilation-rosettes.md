# FAQ: Ventilation Rosettes for Historic Wall Panelling
## 1. What is the purpose of ventilation rosettes in wall panelling?
Ventilation rosettes (Ø 3–5 cm) are used in historic wall panelling, especially from the Gründerzeit period, to allow air circulation behind the panelling. They promote air and moisture exchange between the wall and the timber, thus preventing condensation, mould, and wood movement. This improves durability, stabilises humidity and protects against shrinkage and swelling.

***

## 2. What do typical ventilation rosettes look like and how are they made?
- Round, 3–5 cm diameter

- Ornamented with floral or geometric patterns

- Cast in zinc, iron or aluminium (historically sand cast or die-cast)

- Later also available in brass or bronze

- Modern reproductions can be milled from brass

***

## 3. How do rosettes enable rear ventilation and why is this important?
Rosettes provide controlled air openings at the top and bottom of the panelling. The natural convection effect creates a flow of air, ensuring:

- Consistent climate and humidity behind the wood

- Prevention of condensation and mould growth

- Reduced risk of warping, shrinkage or cracks

- Long-term preservation of both timber and wall

***

## 4. How are original rosettes reproduced today?
- Original rosettes are stripped, cleaned and carefully prepared for sharp-contour casting in brass

- We use originals as models for sand casting or develop similar designs for modern CNC milling

- Available with polished or patinated finish

***

## 5. Are there ready-made or custom options available?
Yes, some manufacturers still produce traditional air vents and rosettes from brass, zinc, aluminium or iron, in historical and custom designs. We offer both authentic reproductions and new interpretations to match your interior.

***

## 6. What are the technical and conservation advantages?
- Promotes healthy indoor climate, prevents moisture damage

- Meets heritage requirements for functional and aesthetic integration

- Flexible placement: for restoration, repair or new installations in historic style
