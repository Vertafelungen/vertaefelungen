# FAQ: Wood Panelling in Historic Buildings
## 1. What is meant by wood panelling in historic buildings?
Wood panelling refers to the cladding of walls (and sometimes ceilings) with panels, frame-and-panel constructions or profiled boards made of solid wood. In historic buildings – especially from the Wilhelminian and Art Nouveau eras – they are both a decorative and protective element shaping the character of the room.

## 2. What were the original functions of panelling?
- **Protection:** Against cold, moisture, and wall surface damage

- **Decoration:** Decorative, often prestigious room ornament – central to style and living culture

- **Acoustics & climate:** Improves acoustics and comfort

- **Integration:** Conceals installations, integrates doors and radiator covers

***

## 3. What typical construction types are there?
- **Dado-height** (approx. 1 m): mostly below windows, as bench cladding or wall finish

- **Half-height** (approx. 1.2–1.4 m): common in corridors, salons, dining rooms

- **Full-height** (up to the ceiling): for representative rooms, libraries, halls

- **Panelled wainscoting:** classic with infills and frames

- **Profiled mouldings and trims:** for structuring, decorative finish, for doors

***

## 4. In which stylistic periods was panelling especially common?
- **Baroque, Rococo:** elaborate, often sculptural carvings and gilding

- **Classicism:** clear structure, simple profiles

- **Historicism/Wilhelminian:** richly profiled, floral and ornamental details

- **Art Nouveau:** flowing lines, floral and organic motifs

- **Bauhaus/1920s:** geometric, understated panels and veneers

***

## 5. How can you recognise historic panelling?
- Solid wood (pine, oak, softwoods), elaborate profiling and panel construction

- Hallmarks of the era: profiles, structure, carving, surfaces

- Old fixing techniques (wooden dowels, wooden nails, concealed screwing)

***

## 6. What are the main aspects in restoration and reproduction?
- **Survey:** Document original dimensions, profiles, wood species

- **Reversibility:** Materials and installation should be removable and non-damaging to the original

- **Material fidelity:** Use of matching woods and traditional techniques

- **Repair:** Replace missing parts, gentle cleaning, protection from moisture and pests

- **Documentation:** All steps should be traceable (photo documentation)

***

## 7. Are there special features in historic buildings?
- Irregular walls, settlement, old plaster layers and installations

- Heritage conservation and energy retrofit requirements

- Often complex integration with existing room structure (doors, radiators, window sills)

***

## 8. How is panelling maintained and preserved?
- Regular, gentle cleaning (dry, damp cloth)

- Refreshing the surface with suitable oils or waxes

- Professional repair of damage caused by pests or moisture

- Avoid harsh cleaning agents or aggressive sanding!
