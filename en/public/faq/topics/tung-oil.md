# FAQ: Tung Oil as a Wood Preservative in Heritage Work
## 1. What is tung oil and what is it used for?
Tung oil (also called Chinese wood oil, obtained from the seeds of the tung tree, Aleurites fordii) is a traditional natural oil used to impregnate and finish wood. It penetrates deeply, polymerises (hardens) well, and forms an elastic, water-repellent protective film – popular for furniture, floors, wood panelling and in conservation.

## 2. What is the difference between natural tung oil and tung oil varnish?
**Natural tung oil (pure tung oil):**

- 100% cold-pressed tung oil, without additives.

- Dries very slowly (often several days), penetrates deeply into the wood and hardens to a tough but matte surface.

- Used primarily in traditional wood protection, demanding restoration and for food-contact surfaces.

**Tung oil varnish (modified with siccatives):**

- Contains additional driers (siccatives) and sometimes small amounts of solvents.

- Dries faster (1–2 days), forms a slightly glossy, water-repellent and durable surface.

- Used where faster curing and more resistance are needed, such as on floors, worktops or exteriors.

## 3. What does tung oil smell like?
Pure tung oil has a mild, nutty, slightly “herbaceous” scent, often considered less obtrusive than linseed oil.  
When drying (oxidising), a subtle, woody-natural odour develops that almost disappears after curing.  
Modified tung oil varnishes may have a slightly stronger, chemical odour due to additives, which usually dissipates after a few days.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of tung oil?
**Advantages:**

- Excellent penetration, deep-acting wood protection

- Permanently elastic, water-repellent protective film

- Hardly yellows or darkens, unlike linseed oil

- Highlights the grain and natural feel of the wood

- Food safe in pure form

**Disadvantages:**

- Long drying times for pure tung oil

- Higher cost than linseed oil

- Pure tung oil can remain “sticky” if applied incorrectly

- Modified tung oil varnish may not be as easily refinished

## 5. How does tung oil differ from other oils?
Tung oil hardens more fully and quickly than linseed oil, is more water-resistant, and forms a harder but still elastic protective film. It is less prone to “stickiness” and yellowing.

## 6. How is tung oil applied to wood?
1. Finely sand, dry and clean the wood.

2. Apply tung oil thinly, allow to soak in for 20–30 minutes.

3. Remove any excess within 1 hour.

4. For saturation, apply 2–3 coats at intervals of 1–2 days, allowing intermediate drying.

5. Apply modified varnishes like a stain; ensure good ventilation.

## 7. Safety and environmental aspects
- Tung oil is non-toxic and food safe (pure oil only).

- Oil-soaked rags are **self-igniting** – always let them dry spread out or store in water.

- Modified varnishes may contain small amounts of solvents or driers.
