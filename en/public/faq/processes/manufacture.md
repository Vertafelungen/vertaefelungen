# FAQ: Manufacture
## 1. How is a historical wall panelling created?
- The original template is measured in detail and recreated in 3D CAD. This enables planning and adaptation to your space, e.g. panel widths, window sills, or radiator covers. The digital model provides parts lists and CNC-ready construction plans for the joinery.

***

## 2. What materials and techniques are used?
- High-quality solid wood, mainly pine or oak, is used with traditional joinery techniques.

- This is supported by modern CAD, NC, and CNC technology. All mouldings, frames, and rails are solid; large-format panel fillings are made from professionally cross-banded boards with thick veneer, sanded and primed with linseed oil.

## 3. Who produces the panelling?
- Manufacture is carried out by our partner joinery Tischlerei Spatzier GmbH in Wiesenburg, a sixth-generation workshop specialising in heritage and sustainability, and winner of multiple awards for sustainable craftsmanship.

## 4. How sustainable is the production process?
- Production uses durable solid wood and traditional construction – creating a product with a lifespan of over 100 years.

- Regionally felled wood is offset by financial support for forest owners converting to climate-resilient mixed forests, in projects certified by the State Forestry Office.

## 5. Which wood species are available?
- We typically use pine or oak – selected to suit your taste and requirements.

***

## 6. How are the surfaces finished?
- All surfaces are sanded and primed with linseed oil – for an authentic wood appearance and protection.

***

## 7. Is every item custom-made?
- Yes – every item is individually tailored to your space and precisely planned, whether a replica of a historical template or a simple design of equal quality.
