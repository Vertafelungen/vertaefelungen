# FAQ: Planning & Ordering

## 1. What is the ordering process?

The ordering process at Vertäfelung & Lambris is clear and transparent:

1. **Non-binding enquiry**  
   Send your enquiry via our contact form, by e-mail, or telephone. Let us know your requirements, dimensions, and optionally a photo or floor plan.

2. **Consultation & offer**  
   After reviewing your details, you will receive individual advice and a tailored quote for your project, including price, delivery time, and alternatives if relevant.

3. **Visualisation & planning (optional)**  
   On request, we provide a visualisation based on your information. This can help with decision-making and as a planning basis.

4. **Order confirmation**  
   Once you accept the offer, you will receive a written order confirmation and (if applicable) an advance invoice.

5. **Production & delivery**  
   Production starts after receipt of the down payment in our partner joinery. We will keep you updated on progress. Delivery is punctual to your specified address.
