# Internal Technical FAQ on Wood Paneling

## What’s the difference between solid wood and veneered paneling?
Solid wood expands/contracts more, but is durable and easier to refinish. Veneered MDF is more dimensionally stable and cost-effective, but not ideal for heavy-use or heritage restorations.

## What wood types do we commonly use?
- **Spruce/Pine**: widely available, easy to process
- **Oak**: robust, ideal for historic reconstructions
- **Linden**: easy to carve, good for moldings and decorative parts
- **MDF (veneered)**: used for modern, non-listed projects

## How are measurements collected from the client?
Via dimensioned floor plans, on-site measurements, or photo documentation with basic wall dimensions. For visualizations, 3–4 precise wall widths and positions of doors/windows are sufficient.

## How does the 3D visualization process work?
We use SketchUp to recreate the space to scale based on the customer’s plan. Wall height, base height, and opening positions are transferred manually. From this, screenshots and perspective views are generated.

## What is the pricing workflow?
1. Preliminary pricing based on meters and style
2. Visualization (charged at 10 % of final price)
3. 50 % deposit upon order confirmation
4. Production after final client approval

## Which joineries do we work with?
We cooperate with several regional partners (in Saxony, Brandenburg, NRW). Selection depends on availability, region and specialization.

## What’s typically included in a delivery?
- Custom-fit paneling elements
- Base and wall trim profiles
- Corner and transition components
- Mounting clips or hidden fixings
- Raw or oiled surfaces

## What special requirements apply to heritage projects?
Original materials are often mandatory. CNC approvals, technical drawings and historic research are part of the planning. On-site measurements by experts are strongly recommended.

## How do we distinguish private clients from resellers?
- **Private clients** get design and pricing from a single source
- **Resellers** (carpenters, planners) receive technical docs, drawings and trade pricing (20–30 % discount)
