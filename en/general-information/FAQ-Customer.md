# Frequently Asked Questions about Wood Paneling (FAQ)

## What is historic wood paneling?
Historic wood paneling refers to wall cladding made of solid or veneered wood, recreated according to historical styles. Originally, paneling served for thermal insulation, wall protection, and decorative design.

## Which styles are available?
We reconstruct paneling in Baroque, Classical, Gothic, and bourgeois styles – or based on your own template if preferred.

## What type of wood is used?
Depending on the project: mostly spruce, pine, oak, or linden wood. Other woods available upon request.

## How is the paneling installed?
Our systems use hidden clips, trim strips, or traditional wooden dowels and frame anchors – depending on your wall structure.

## Can I submit my own room measurements?
Yes, we create a visualization and customized offer based on your floor plan.

## Is a deposit required?
Yes. After accepting the offer, a deposit of 50 % is required. Production then begins via our partner joinery.

## How long does production take?
Between 6 and 10 weeks – depending on size, wood type, and workload.

## Can I install the paneling myself?
Experienced DIYers can install it themselves. We provide a detailed installation guide. We can also recommend a professional installer.
