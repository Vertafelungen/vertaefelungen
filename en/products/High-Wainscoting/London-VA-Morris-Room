# Morris Room – London, V&A Museum (P0003)

In 1861, Sir Henry Cole, founding director of the South Kensington Museum, commissioned a young William Morris to design the “Green Dining Room,” now known as the Morris Room. This early masterpiece of the Arts and Crafts movement blends Elizabethan Revival proportions with Gothic Revival details, and was developed with contributions from Philip Webb and Edward Burne-Jones. The original room remains preserved and accessible to visitors at the V&A.
**Form, proportions, and structure** are faithfully reproduced based on the original design. The panel reaches a height of 214 cm and was originally painted green.

Custom-made to order – production time approx. **6 weeks**, plus shipping.
