## 1. Mittelalter (ca. 1100–1500)
### Funktionalität und Symbolik

**Stilmerkmale:**

**Material:**

**Beispiele:**
---
In the Middle Ages, paneling served primarily to protect walls. Early examples can be found in monasteries and castles, often made of oak or fir – unadorned, rarely profiled.
- Vertical boards
- Occasionally chamfered or with carved vine motifs
- Oak, fir, or larch
- **Maulbronn Monastery (Baden-Württemberg):** Remnants of late medieval wood paneling from around 1470
- **Eltz Castle (Rhineland-Palatinate):** Gothic wood paneling with simple tracery panels

## 2. Renaissance (c. 1500–1650)### Geometric Clarity and Representation
During the Renaissance, paneled wall systems became common in bourgeois townhouses. Architectural principles from antiquity were applied to interiors.

**Stylistic features:**

- Cassettes (recessed panels)  

- Pilasters and entablature-like structures

**Surfaces:**

- Usually oiled or dark-stained

**Examples:**

- **Hartenfels Castle (Torgau):** Paneled rooms influenced by early Italian Renaissance  

- **Town Hall of Augsburg:** Wood paneling with inlays and Mannerist detailing

---

## 3. Baroque & Rococo (c. 1650–1780)### Opulence and Movement
In the Baroque period, paneling became a medium of theatrical display. Framed panels, volutes, carved ornaments, and gilded decoration dominated.

**Stylistic features:**

- Full-height wall paneling  

- Curved forms and lavish embellishment

**Surfaces:**

- Lacquered, painted, or gilded

**Examples:**

- **Ludwigsburg Palace (Baden-Württemberg):** State rooms with lavish, partly gilded paneling  

- **Amalienburg Pavilion (Munich):** Exquisite Rococo paneling with pastel color schemes and carving

---

## 4. Neoclassicism (c. 1780–1840)### A Return to Order
As a reaction to Rococo excess, Neoclassicism became more restrained and architectural. Paneling followed strict proportions and classical ideals.

**Stylistic features:**

- Rectangular cassettes  

- Flat profiles and rhythmic arrangement

**Color scheme:**

- Often painted white or light gray

**Examples:**

- **Charlottenhof Palace (Potsdam):** Classically inspired wall paneling  

- **Villa Hamilton (Dessau-Wörlitz):** Representative of early Prussian Neoclassicism

---

## 5. Historicism (c. 1840–1910)### Referencing the Past
In the 19th century, historical styles were consciously revived. Paneling reflected Neo-Gothic, Neo-Renaissance, or Neo-Baroque design.

**Stylistic features:**

- Stylistic mixing (Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, Baroque Revival)  

- Mass-produced decorative elements through machine work

**Examples:**

- **New Town Hall, Munich:** Neo-Gothic paneling in council chambers  

- **Villa Stuck (Munich):** Eclectic and symbol-laden wall paneling

---

## 6. Art Nouveau (c. 1890–1914)### Ornament and Line
Art Nouveau paneling often blended with furniture, door frames, and lighting. Flowing lines and floral inlays became central design elements.

**Stylistic features:**

- Organic curves  

- Floral marquetry  

- Integrated glass elements

**Materials:**

- Cherry, maple, walnut

**Examples:**

- **Otto Wagner’s Townhouse (Vienna):** Built-in lighting and stylized paneling  

- **Villa Esche (Chemnitz, by Henry van de Velde):** Elegant wall treatments with flowing lines

---

## 7. Bauhaus & Modernism (from 1920 onward)### Reduction to Essentials
With modernism, traditional paneling largely disappeared. However, high-end interiors continued to use understated wood paneling as a deliberate contrast to stark architecture.

**Stylistic features:**

- Plain, flush-mounted panels  

- Smooth, unornamented surfaces

**Examples:**

- **Haus Schminke (Löbau):** Functionalist interiors with minimal wood paneling  

- **Haus Lange & Haus Esters (Krefeld):** Refined walnut and mahogany paneling in a minimalist context

---

## Conclusion: Between Function and Representation
Wood paneling is more than wall covering – it is a mirror of its time, of taste, and of craftsmanship. Whether rustic, ornate, or strictly geometric, each era has left its mark on this versatile element.

Today, historical restoration or faithful reconstruction requires a careful balance between tradition, materiality, and authenticity.
