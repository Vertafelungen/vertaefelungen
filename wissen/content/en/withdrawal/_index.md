## Summary
This knowledge page intentionally works as a stub and does not reproduce the full cancellation and withdrawal text. The legally relevant policy is maintained in the shop as a single source to avoid conflicting versions for deadlines, process steps, or exceptions. This keeps the legal basis tied to the transactional environment where orders are placed. For binding details, always refer to the linked shop page.

## Authoritative version in the shop
The complete cancellation policy in the shop contains the relevant information on withdrawal periods, requirements, procedural steps, and return-related handling in one maintained document. The central source is used so updates are legally coherent and immediately reflected where the order workflow takes place.

Use this link for the authoritative version:

## Notes specific to this document
- This page is a routing and orientation page, not a standalone legal cancellation policy.
- Legally relevant deadline calculations and formal requirements are authoritative only in the shop wording.
- Practical process details for withdrawal handling and follow-up return coordination are governed by the linked source.
- Any exclusions or limitations of withdrawal rights must be taken from the full shop policy text.
- The purpose of this stub is to keep a stable `/wissen/` endpoint without creating duplicate legal long text.
- If you need certainty for a specific order case, rely on the currently published shop policy.
