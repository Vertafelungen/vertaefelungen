## Summary
This knowledge page is intentionally a stub and does not duplicate the full imprint text. Legal provider information is maintained in one central location in the shop to prevent diverging versions across different site sections. This approach follows a single-source-of-truth process and keeps legal references consistent over time. For any binding provider identification details, the shop page is authoritative.

## Authoritative version in the shop
All complete information regarding provider identification, responsible entity details, and official contact channels is maintained centrally in the shop. This knowledge page only preserves discoverability under `/wissen/` while avoiding parallel legal texts that might become outdated.

Please use the following link as the only binding source:

- The legally relevant provider details are only authoritative in the linked shop version.
- If contact channels or responsible party data change, the shop text is updated first.
- For legal references, compliance checks, or documentation, cite the wording from the shop page.
