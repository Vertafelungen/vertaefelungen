Skirting boards create a clean transition between floor and wall. In period interiors they are more than protective strips: height, profile and junctions define the room's proportions.\n\n**Typical topics:**\n- choosing a suitable height relative to ceiling height and any panelling\n- profile shapes (round, cove, hollow, ogee)\n- junctions with door surrounds and wall fields\n\nSelect a skirting profile to see dimensions, variants and images.
