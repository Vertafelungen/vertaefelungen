## Quick answer

- SL0006 - with cyma 58/18 is a variant in the baseboards range.
- Suitable for coherent period-style refurbishment projects.
- Profile, dimensions, and finishes are selected to match each room condition.
- Photos, wall dimensions, and style goals are enough for a reliable pre-selection.

## Practical context

In practice, the profile is evaluated together with wall build-up, floor junctions, and door casings. This keeps proportions consistent and clarifies installation interfaces early. For first review, photos and a simple layout are usually sufficient.

## Decisions & variants

Useful variants are defined by profile height, edge geometry, material, and finish system. Heritage-led projects usually mirror existing detailing, while newer interiors often prefer a cleaner and more reduced profile language.

## Process & planning

Typical workflow: define requirements, choose a reference profile, validate dimensions, approve production, and prepare installation. For complex rooms, a short measurement and installation alignment meeting prevents rework.

## Cost logic

Cost logic depends on profile complexity, material choice, linear meters, and finish level. Extra effort is typically driven by custom radii, adjustments to uneven existing walls, or higher coordination needs.

## Common mistakes & how to avoid them

Frequent mistakes include missing reference heights, late clarification of junction details, and profile selection without checking door and casing geometry. These risks are reduced by early profile approval and clear dimension references.
