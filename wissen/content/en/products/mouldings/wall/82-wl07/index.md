## Quick answer

- Wall Moulding 07 is a profiled wall moulding for classic interior wall articulation.
- Suitable for period-home renovation, classic new builds, and accent walls.
- Visual quality depends on proportions, panel layout, and clean transitions to doors/skirting.
- Profile depth and room dimensions should be coordinated early in planning.

## Practical context

In practice, this moulding is usually part of a panel grid: first define height lines and axes, then distribute wall panels. This approach helps visually calm uneven existing walls. In heritage-led projects, matching door and skirting profiles is especially important.

## Decisions & variants

Common variants range from restrained, shallow profiles for calm rooms to more articulated profiles for representative spaces. Another decision is whether the moulding is only used as a horizontal break line or as a full vertical-and-horizontal panel system.

## Process & planning

Typical workflow: survey existing conditions, choose profile, agree panel layout, prepare material, install, then apply primer and finish system. Transitions to architraves and skirting are checked before final fixing.

## Cost logic

Cost logic is driven by profile geometry, linear meters, number of miters, substrate preparation, and finish build-up. Complex room geometries and many transitions increase installation effort.

## Common mistakes & how to avoid them

Frequent mistakes include inconsistent panel spacing, mismatched profile heights, and underplanned corners/transitions. Avoid these issues with a clear layout plan, sample fields, and early coordination at doors, skirting, and ceiling interfaces.
