High wainscoting has a stronger architectural impact than low panelling: it structures wall surfaces, frames doors and openings, and reinforces a historic character in period interiors.\n\n**Typical use cases:** hallways, living rooms, dining rooms, staircases.\n\n**Workflow:** choose reference → measure/plan → 3D visualisation → fabrication & installation via partner joinery.\n\nIf you share room dimensions, ceiling height and the desired style, the suitable profiles and panel layout can be narrowed down efficiently.
