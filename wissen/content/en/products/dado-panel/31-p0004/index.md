## Quick answer

- P0004 - Berlin - Sophienstraße is intended for classic interiors with clear line work.
- The profile supports clean transitions between wall panels and mouldings.
- Suitable for renovation and new build projects that need a calm premium finish.
- Final detailing is matched to room proportions, existing fabric, and design intent.

## Practical context

In practice, P0004 - Berlin - Sophienstraße is used when historic character and reliable day-to-day performance need to work together. Key factors are substrate condition, junction details, and expected room use.

## Decisions & variants

Typical variants concern profile height, corner treatment, and how the element connects to skirting or wall mouldings. Early mock-ups and reference details reduce coordination risk.

## Process & planning

The workflow starts with survey and photo documentation, followed by profile selection, junction decisions, and an installation plan. After preparation, elements are installed to line and level and then readied for final coating.

## Cost logic

Cost logic is mainly driven by geometry, substrate preparation, level of detailing, and installation effort. Extra work such as heritage adaptation or custom junctions adds predictable effort.

## Common mistakes & how to avoid them

Frequent errors include undefined datum lines, late detail decisions, and missing trade coordination. Prevention: confirm layout grid, junctions, and coating build-up early.
