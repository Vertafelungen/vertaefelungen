Creation in SketchUp - Import of the floor plan into Trimble SketchUp  - 3D model creation with scaled walls, door frames, window openings  - Adding typical paneling profiles (e.g. Baroque, Classical, Historicist)  ## 4. Result - Screenshots created for client approval  - Visualization is included at **10 % of the project cost**  - Once approved, a detailed drawing is prepared for the joinery  ## 5. Communication Use - Helps clients decide on style and height  - Optional: different molding variants, baseboards, color options'
