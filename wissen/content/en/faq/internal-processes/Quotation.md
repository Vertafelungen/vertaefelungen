title: 'Quotation and Order Process 1. Initial Contact and Basic Info - The customer sends an inquiry via form or email, including room details, chosen style, and preferred wood type. - We offer a telephone or in-person consultation upon request. 2. Preliminary Estimate - Based on running meters and style, we provide a rough price range (free of charge). - This initial estimate serves as an orientation for the customer. 3. Visualization & Planning Phase - Upon positive feedback, our team creates a scale-accurate 3D visualization using SketchUp. - We charge 10% of the estimated total price as a planning fee (e.g., €1,000 on a €10,000 estimate). - Visualization forms the basis for the detailed final quotation and potential approval. 4. Final Offer and Approval - Based on approved visualization, we generate a detailed quotation, including: - Material and variant choices (e.g., spruce/oak, DIY-kit vs. professional installation) - Quantity and running meter details - Installation options (DIY or by a partner installer) - Upon accepting the offer, a 50% deposit is required. 5. Production and Installation - Production begins once deposit is received. - Post-production, we arrange delivery or coordinate professional installation. - Remaining balance is due upon delivery or completion of installation. 6. Finalization & Completion - Conduct final inspection of installation results. - Issue final invoice after successful handover to the customer.'
