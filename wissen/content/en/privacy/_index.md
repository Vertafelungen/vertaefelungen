## Summary
This knowledge page is intentionally presented as a reference stub instead of a full privacy policy. Data protection information is centrally maintained in the shop to avoid version drift between informational pages and transaction-related platform functions. Keeping one maintained legal source also improves clarity when policy details are updated. For legally relevant privacy information, the shop text is the authoritative version.

## Authoritative version in the shop
The central shop policy includes complete information on processing contexts, functional and technical requirements, potential analytics or tracking elements, storage-related aspects, and data subject rights. This page exists to keep the privacy route reachable in the knowledge section while preventing duplicate legal long-form content.

Please consult the binding policy here:
