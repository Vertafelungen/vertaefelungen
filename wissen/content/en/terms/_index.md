## Summary
This knowledge page intentionally does not include a full legal copy of the terms and conditions. The complete legal text is maintained centrally in the shop so that ordering, contract formation, and related provisions are governed by one consistent source. This prevents conflicts between a knowledge article and checkout-facing legal content. For binding terms, please rely exclusively on the shop version.

## Authoritative version in the shop
The complete terms text in the shop covers scope, contract process, ordering steps, payment framework, and further contractual provisions in one maintained source. This follows a single-source-of-truth model so updates do not need to be synchronized across multiple independent legal pages.

## Notes specific to this document
- This page is a structural pointer within the knowledge area and is not an independent legal terms page.
- Contract-relevant wording for order placement and acceptance is authoritative only in the shop text.
- Any scope distinctions, including potential notes for business buyers or resellers, must be taken from the linked source.
- Summaries on this page are non-binding and should not be used as a substitute for the full wording.
- If contractual clauses are revised, the shop publication is the controlling and updated reference.
- The purpose here is continuity of navigation under `/wissen/` without legal duplication risk.
