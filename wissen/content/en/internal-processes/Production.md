# Production
## 1. Partner Network & Collaboration
- We partner with specialized joineries in Saxony, Brandenburg, and North Rhine-Westphalia.

- Workshop selection depends on wood type (e.g. oak, spruce), style (historic or modern), and project location.

## 2. Technical Planning & Coordination
- After order acceptance, we prepare detailed drawings specifying measurements, profiles, and materials.

- These drawings, and if needed CAD/CNC files, are shared with the workshop for production setup.

## 3. Parts Lists & Material Procurement
- We generate accurate parts lists: number of paneling components, moldings, trims, decorative elements.

- Workshops order wood blanks, veneer sheets, or custom profiles; CNC parts may be procured externally.

## 4. Processing & Surface Finishing
- Milling, profiling, and, if required, carving or engraving according to historic models.

- Surface finishing: raw, oiled, clear-coated, or patinated as per client request or heritage compliance.

- Finishing can be done either in-house or on-site.

## 5. Quality Control
- Visual inspection, dimension checks, and trial assembly in the workshop if necessary.

- For special projects: photo documentation and client approval before dispatch.

## 6. Packaging & Shipping
- Components are labeled and packed into custom-fit units.

- Delivery arranged via freight to you or the installation partner.

## 7. Special Projects: Heritage & Historic Work
- Use of authentic materials and traditional joinery techniques (e.g. tongue-and-groove, dowels).

- Coordination with heritage authorities and integration of historic references and drawings.
